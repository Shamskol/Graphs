Connected Components
--------------------
A set of nodes that is connected to one another in some way.
Graphs can have multiple sets of connected nodes that are disjoint.
A set of connected nodes is called a "connected component".
Counting connected components:
Algorithm 1:
While there are unvisited nodes:
    Choose an unvisited node
    Traverse from that node, marking each as visited
    Increment connected component counter
Algorithm 2:
(Same as algorithm 1, but more like we might code it.)
For each node in the graph:
    If it's unvisited:
        Traverse from that node, marking each as visited
        Increment connected component counter
