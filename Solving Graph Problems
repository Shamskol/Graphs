Solving Graph Prpblems

1. Describe the problem usinggraphs terminology
   What are your nodes ?
   When are nodes connected?
   What are your connected components?

2. Build your graph or write your getNeighbors()
   Figure out how to get thenode's edges


3. Choose your algorithm, and applyit.


EXAMPLE 

Given two words (gegin_word and end_word), and a dictionary' word list,
return the shortest transformation sequence from begin_word to end_word, such that:

Only one letter can be changed at a time.

Each transformed word must exist in the word list. Note that begin_word is not a transformed word.

begin_word = "hit"
end_word = "cog"

return = ["hit", "hot", "cot", "cog"]
 
begin_word = "sail"
end_word = "boat"

["sail", "bail", "boil", "boll", "bolt", "boat"]


1. Translate into graphs terminology
   Nodes: words
   There is an edge ifwords are different by one letter, and both are in the word list

2. getNeighbors   

Choose our algorithm: BFS
